READ ME!

Open IP.txt in this folder and type the IP address of the server. This is displayed in the console window of the server application.

When playing the game, click to make the snake boost!

Snakes will move automatically upon connection so instances of the client application need to be loaded in quick succession for them to be on the screen at the same time.
If too much time has passed and you can not see the other snakes, if you boost towards the top left corner of the screen int client 2, you should catch up with the first client's snake!
